The provided text is a report on a Solar Flare Analysis System group project, primarily focusing on the contributions and findings of one team member, Bryan Miramontes. The report outlines Bryan's responsibilities, which include assisting in the development of algorithms for specific tasks and analyzing intensity maps. The report then delves into the team's efforts in Subtask A, where they discuss the creation of an algorithm to subdivide data into batches and the resulting intensity maps for selected batches.

Furthermore, the text explores Method 2, executed by Bryan Miramontes, for generating intensity scatter plots during Batches 1 and 11. The analysis of these scatter plots reveals spatial distribution patterns and intensity variations. Subtask B involves the development of a hotspot discovery algorithm, with Bryan responsible for one threshold (d2). The algorithm's success is discussed, emphasizing its consistency with intensity maps and time series plots.

The report provides insights into data analysis using intensity thresholds (d1 and d2) and highlights their effectiveness in capturing varying solar flare intensities and spatial distributions. The concluding remarks discuss Subtask C, handled by Dylan, and provide interpretations of the spatial distribution of solar flares in different batches, particularly emphasizing the central region's significance.

In summary, the text presents a comprehensive overview of Bryan Miramontes' contributions to the Solar Flare Analysis System project, detailing tasks, algorithms, and findings related to solar flare intensity and spatial distribution.
